/*
This file is intentionally left empty (or can be deleted).
Styling for the 'contact-form' component is now managed by the SADS engine
(public/js/sads-style-engine.js) based on data-sads-* attributes
in templates/components/contact-form/contact-form.html.

CSS for .success and .error classes on the status div, if desired,
would need to be added here or in a global/utility CSS file,
as SADS doesn't currently style dynamically added classes unless they
are also SADS-ified.
