# Linter Configuration Notes

This document outlines known linting issues that are best addressed by configuring the linters in the CI environment (e.g., Super-linter setup) rather than by altering the source code in a way that would be functionally incorrect or undesirable.

## HTMLHint: `doctype-first`

- **Issue**: HTMLHint (via Super-linter) reports a `doctype-first` error for HTML partials (e.g., `blocks/hero.html`, `templates/components/features/features.html`, etc.). Some partials are in `blocks/` while newer components might be in `templates/components/`.
- **Reason**: These files are HTML partials, intended to be included in the main `index.html` by the `build.py` script. As partials, they should not contain a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration. The `doctype-first` rule is intended for complete HTML documents.
- **Suggested Solution**: Configure HTMLHint in the CI pipeline to:
  - Ignore the `doctype-first` rule specifically for files within the `blocks/` and `templates/components/` directories.
  - Alternatively, if HTMLHint is invoked directly, adjust its ruleset (e.g., via an `.htmlhintrc` file if Super-Linter picks it up) to accommodate these partials. For example, exclude these directories from this specific rule or from HTMLHint checks altogether if they are only meant to be validated as part of the assembled `index.html`.

## JSCPD: Duplication Warnings

- **Issue**: JSCPD (JavaScript/JSON Copy Paste Detector, also used for other languages by Super-linter) reports code duplication between the generated `index.html` file and the source HTML block files in the `blocks/` directory.
- **Reason**: The `index.html` file is dynamically generated by the `build.py` script, which concatenates the content of the HTML files from the `blocks/` directory. Therefore, the content of these blocks will naturally be present in both the source partials and the final assembled `index.html`. This is by design and not accidental code duplication that needs refactoring in the traditional sense.
- **Suggested Solution**: Configure JSCPD in the CI pipeline to:
  - Ignore the generated `index.html` file for duplication checks.
  - Alternatively, or in addition, ignore the `blocks/` directory if the primary concern is duplication in non-template/non-partial code.
  - A `.jscpd.json` configuration file might be respected by Super-Linter if placed in the repository root, allowing for more granular control over exclusions and thresholds.

Addressing these issues via linter configuration will lead to a cleaner CI output without compromising the modular structure of the HTML blocks.

## CSS Linting (Stylelint)

CSS files (`.css`) are linted using [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/).

- **Configuration**:
  - Stylelint is configured in `.stylelintrc.json`.
- **Running Linters**:
  - `npm run lint:css` - Runs stylelint to check CSS files.
  - `npm run lint:css:fix` - Runs stylelint and attempts to automatically fix issues.

## Python Linting (Ruff & MyPy)

Python code (`.py` files) is linted using [Ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/) for formatting and general code quality (style, errors, etc.) and [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for static type checking.

- **Configuration**:

  - Ruff is configured in `pyproject.toml` under the `[tool.ruff]` and `[tool.ruff.lint]` sections.
  - MyPy is configured in `pyproject.toml` under the `[tool.mypy]` section.
  - Development dependencies, including `ruff` and `mypy`, are listed in `requirements-dev.txt`. Install them using `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.

- **Running Linters**:
  - `npm run lint:py` - Runs both Ruff and MyPy to check Python files.
  - `npm run lint:py:fix` - Runs Ruff with autofixing enabled, followed by MyPy.
