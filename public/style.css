  /* NOTE: This padding might need adjustment if the new header component has a different height
     or if the sticky behavior changes. For now, keeping it as is.
     If the header is no longer sticky or its height changes, this rule might need to be
     moved to be component-specific or adjusted globally.
     Given the header component's CSS retains `position: sticky`, this should still be relevant.

  /* This 'main' rule was already present and is being kept.
     The original had another 'main' rule specific to this media query.
     It's possible it was meant to override the general 'main { padding-top: 20px }'
     for smaller screens. If the header height changes significantly in mobile view
     due to the menu opening or other factors, this might need to be revisited.
     For now, the more general 'main { padding-top: 20px; }' from earlier in the file
     will apply unless a more specific rule for 'main' within this media query is added.
     The original duplicate 'main' rule within this media query is removed to avoid confusion.
     The padding for 'main' is handled by a single rule outside this media query for now.
     If header height is different on mobile, the main padding might need adjustment here.
